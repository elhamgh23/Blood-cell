# Blood Cell Type Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on **automated blood cell classification** for disease diagnosis. It aims to tackle challenges in medical image interpretation and preprocessing while leveraging advanced classification techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Features
- **Automated Classification:** Uses machine learning models to classify blood cell types.
- **Medical Image Processing:** Implements preprocessing techniques for image enhancement.
- **Multi-Class Classification:** Evaluates multiple classifiers for improved accuracy.
- **Diagnostic Applications:** Aims to assist in disease diagnosis through automated analysis.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images of different blood cell types.
- Data augmentation and preprocessing steps are applied to enhance model performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Image normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Techniques such as CNN-based feature extraction.
3. **Model Training:** Multiple classification models including CNNs and traditional ML classifiers.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
